{"title": "Natural selection on protein-coding genes in the human genome.", "abstract": "Comparisons of DNA polymorphism within species to divergence between species enables the discovery of molecular adaptation in evolutionarily constrained genes as well as the differentiation of weak from strong purifying selection. The extent to which weak negative and positive darwinian selection have driven the molecular evolution of different species varies greatly, with some species, such as Drosophila melanogaster, showing strong evidence of pervasive positive selection, and others, such as the selfing weed Arabidopsis thaliana, showing an excess of deleterious variation within local populations. Here we contrast patterns of coding sequence polymorphism identified by direct sequencing of 39 humans for over 11,000 genes to divergence between humans and chimpanzees, and find strong evidence that natural selection has shaped the recent molecular evolution of our species. Our analysis discovered 304 (9.0%) out of 3,377 potentially informative loci showing evidence of rapid amino acid evolution. Furthermore, 813 (13.5%) out of 6,033 potentially informative loci show a paucity of amino acid differences between humans and chimpanzees, indicating weak negative selection and/or balancing selection operating on mutations at these loci. We find that the distribution of negatively and positively selected genes varies greatly among biological processes and molecular functions, and that some classes, such as transcription factors, show an excess of rapidly evolving genes, whereas others, such as cytoskeletal proteins, show an excess of genes with extensive amino acid polymorphism within humans and yet little amino acid divergence between humans and chimpanzees.", "journal": "Nature", "date": "2005-10-20", "author": ["Bustamante, Carlos D", "Fledel-Alon, Adi", "Williamson, Scott", "Nielsen, Rasmus", "Hubisz, Melissa Todd", "Glanowski, Stephen", "Tanenbaum, David M", "White, Thomas J", "Sninsky, John J", "Hernandez, Ryan D", "Civello, Daniel", "Adams, Mark D", "Cargill, Michele", "Clark, Andrew G"], "doi": "10.1038/nature04240", "pmid": "16237444"}

{"title": "Withdrawal: Pigment epithelium-derived factor inhibits angiogenesis via regulated intracellular proteolysis of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1.", "abstract": "Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) has been identified as one of the most potent of endogenous negative regulators of blood vessel growth in the body. Here we report that PEDF is able to inhibit growth factor-induced angiogenesis in microvascular endothelial cells through a novel pathway requiring cleavage and intracellular translocation of the transmembrane domain of the VEGFR-1. Analysis of the subcellular distribution of VEGFR-1 revealed the appearance of an 80-kDa C-terminal domain in the cytosol of cells treated with VEGF and PEDF that correlated with a decrease of the full-length receptor in the nuclear and cytoskeletal fractions. This regulated intramembrane proteolysis is dependent on gamma-secretase because inhibition of gamma-secretase abolished the inhibitory effect of PEDF on VEGF-induced angiogenesis as well as VEGFR-1 cleavage. The addition of PEDF to microvascular endothelial cells significantly increases gamma-secretase activity even in the absence of VEGF, showing that VEGF binding to VEGF-R1 is essential for substrate availability. This increase in activity was associated with translocation of presenilin 1 from the perinuclear region to the cell membrane. PEDF was also able to inhibit VEGF-induced phosphorylation of VEGFR-1. Taken together we have identified two novel pathways by which PEDF inhibits VEGF-induced angiogenesis: regulated intramembrane proteolysis and inhibition of phosphorylation. This confirms the importance of PEDF and VEGFR-1 in the negative regulation of angiogenesis.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2006", "author": ["Cai, Jun", "Jiang, Wen G", "Grant, Maria B", "Boulton, Mike"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M507401200", "pmid": "16339148"}
